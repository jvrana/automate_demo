# PyDemo Automator

Runs scripted coded demos for your projects. Save your code as a file run `python run_demo.py`.
The script automates types to give the illusion of a human typing.

## Usage

```bash
python run_demo.py <path_to_code> -r <float> -i <boolean>
```

- r: speed of run
- i: whether to ignore other comments


use `# wait 1` in code to wait for 1 seconds.

You can use something like giphy capture to grab your video.
